# Arduino_Led
Turning on an LED using a button in an Arduino Uno simulator

## Description
The idea behind the project is to create a simple button-activated toggle switch using an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, a LED, a push button, two resistors, and some wires. The LED is connected to pin 3 of the Arduino Uno, while the push button is connected to pin 6. In the Arduino program, the push button is read and the LED is toggled on and off based on its current status. The program turns the LED on when you press the button, and it turns it off when you press the button again. With the Arduino Uno, you can control a LED easily and effectively using a push button.
